# Distance Learning Tweets

As schools transitioned to online learning due to COVID-19, there was a wide range of responses from teachers, parents, and students. Some students found online classes condusive to their learning style while other students struggled to adapt. Through various social media platforms, people have been able to share their varying thoughts and emotions towards virtual learning. As a student who experienced the transition, I found some aspects on online classes to beneficial such as the increased scheduling flexability. However, many of my peers and professors have expressed opposing views. When I came across a dataset of distance learning related Tweets, I was interesting to see the distribution of positive and negative feelings across the world. In this analysis, I use text mining techniques to explore sentiment towards online learning by calculating tweet polarities. I also use the topic modeling method Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover common themes across the tweets.
